Parallel Find-Me (Simultaneous Ringing) Example

Overview:
- Dial extension 7000 from any internal phone in this example.
- Asterisk will attempt to ring PJSIP/6003 and PJSIP/6004 at the same time for 30 seconds.
- If any endpoint answers, the call is bridged to the answering endpoint.
- If none answer, the dialplan falls back to the existing Find Me sequence and/or voicemail.

How it works:
- The dialplan builds a dial string containing multiple PJSIP endpoints separated by '&'.
  Example: PJSIP/6003&PJSIP/6004
- The Dial() application with that string rings all endpoints simultaneously.
- The 'g' option on Dial returns control to the dialplan upon answer so the
  call flow can inspect ${DIALSTATUS} and proceed accordingly.

Notes and extensions:
- You can add more endpoints to the DIAL_TARGETS variable separated with '&',
  for example: PJSIP/6003&PJSIP/6004&PJSIP/6005
- In environments where you want to avoid dialing unregistered endpoints, add
  a pre-check to only include endpoints with active contacts. This repo's
  example keeps the dialstring simple for clarity.
- Adjust RING_TIME to control how long the endpoints ring.

Testing:
1. Register clients for 6003 and 6004 (softphones or devices).
2. Call 7000 from an internal extension.
3. Observe both endpoints ringing.
4. Answer on one endpoint and verify the call is bridged.
5. Let the call time out and confirm the fallback logic runs.
